## Introduction

The decomposition of spatial genetic structure is ...

Genetic covariance is a measure of the extent to which two or more populations or locales appear to share a common evolutionary trajectory.

This manuscript develops a heuristic approach for measuring, comparing, and classifying differing spatial patterns

## Spatial Structure

## Measures of Congruence

## Example: Human & Drosophilia
